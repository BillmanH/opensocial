# Loading your data

So let's say you just exported all of your photos from a major social media site and now want to upload them. 

First you need to scan that file

## Uploading your photos/files

* Update: `acceptable_image_types = ["png", "jpg"]` to limit only the files you want (you pay for your storage)
* Create a `blob_keys.yaml` file in the root directory and enter your keys.
